    you. She is on to me, I cannot risk it! I've gotten this far and I'm not going
    to let her destroy that. Soon will I be there with you, on the other side. That
    tought brings me happiness. I won't be long. Anyways, how are the kids? I hope
    you're watching over them while I'm gone. Are their new family good? I truly
    hope so. I have to go now but we will meet soon. I promise! \n\nKind regards,
    your beloved.\n\n"
